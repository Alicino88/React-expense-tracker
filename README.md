# React-expense-tracker

I have built this expense tracker using React. The app is divided in two parts:

- a form where you can add a new expense (including title, amount, and date)
- a section with a year filter: here the expenses are shown according to what year the user clicks on. 

Interesting concepts implemented while building the app:
- useContext to manage light and dark theme
- two-way data binding
- state lifting
- input validation & dynamic css
- filter method
